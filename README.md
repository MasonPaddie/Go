# How To Play GO!
Written by: Mason Paddie

## A Little Background
Go is a chinese board game that was invented over two millenium ago. The goal of the game is to surround the most amount of territory on the board. To do this, one must play their pieces so that they can form groups and encircle their oppenents. The logic of the game is simpler and easier to understand than chess, but the vast amount of options makes it more difficult to recognize patterns and predict moves. As an example of the underlying complexity in the simplicity of go, computers were able to beat world champions of checkers in 1992 and world champions of chess in 1997. It was not until 2016 that a computer was able to beat world chamipons of go. 

## The Board
Go is played on a 19x19 board that initally has no pieces on it.
